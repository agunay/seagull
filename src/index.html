            <h1>WELCOME TO BRIGHTON!</h1>
            <p>Join us and take action for Brighton's coastal environment today!</p>
            <h3>I PLEDGE TO TAKE ACTION AND SUPPORT BRIGHTON'S COASTAL ENVIRONMENT BY:</h3>
            <div id="pledge">
                <h3>DISPOSING MY RUBBISH RESPONSIBLY</h3>
                <p>To prevent ocean pollution I will dispose of my rubbish into a bin with capacity (recyling where possible)</p>
                <h3>CARRYING AND USING A REUSABLE CUP</h3>
                <p>To reduce waste I will use my (clean) reusable cup for purchasing coffee or other hot drinks during my stay in Brighton.</p>
                <h3>TAKING #3FORTHESEA</h3>
                <p>To prevent ocean pollution I will collect, clear and dispose of 3 items of rubbish, each and every time I visit one of Brighton's beaches or green spaces.</p>       
            </div> 
            <p>These three small actions made collectively, will go a long way to reducing waste and marine pollution, and to preserving and protecting Brighton's coastal environment and all its inhabitants.</p>        
            <p>Thank you for taking action for the environment!</p>
